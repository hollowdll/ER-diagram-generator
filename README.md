# ER-diagram-generator
Generate Entity Relationship Diagrams by giving instructions as a simple DDL script to the application.

This project is going to be a cross-platform desktop application made with electron framework. A possible web-based version might be developed at a later time.

# Tools and tech stack
This project is meant for learning purposes.

I will be practicing the following technologies:
- Electron, NodeJS, TypeScript
- Svelte for frontend
- Tailwind for CSS
- Maybe some database?
- Probably more tools/libraries

# Documentation
Since this project might scale to be large, I am considering making a documentation for it and its APIs. This section will be updated at a later time.

# How to use
This section will be updated at a later time as well. This project is going to include my own made Data Definition Language (DDL), that I will be developing specifically for this project. More about this in the future.
